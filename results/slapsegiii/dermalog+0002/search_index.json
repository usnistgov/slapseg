To be evaluated under SlapSeg III, algorithms must segment the timing corpus, on average, in under 1 500 milliseconds. This maximum reference time is documented in the SlapSeg III test plan, and is subject to change. Times are measured by running a single process on an isolated compute node equipped with an Intel Gold 6254 CPU (submissions received prior to February 2022 were timed with a Intel Xeon E5-4650 CPU). Box plots of segmentation times are separated by slap orientation and capture technology in Figure 2.1. Tabular representations are enumerated in Table 2.1. Results are reported in milliseconds.

Plots of segmentation centers for the right hand TwoInch data are shown in Figure 2.2 and plots of segmentation centers for the left hand are shown in Figure 2.3. Blank lines that may appear in the plots are not rendering artifacts. Rather, they are indicative of image downsampling. Centers have been normalized to 500 pixels per inch. Points in each plot are plotted with a semi-transparent opacity. This results in points of particular color appearing “darker” to indicate a higher frequency of the observed value, while “lighter” points indicate a lower observed frequency.

Figure 2.5: Segmentation position dimensions for left hand TwoInch data. 2.3 Detailed Segmentation Statistics This section shows detailed results of segmentation of TwoInch data. Values in each table are the percentage that the variable in the left-most column was correctly segmented. Each table has three columns of percentages. The Standard Scoring column shows the percentage of correctly-segmented positions based on the scoring metrics defined in the SlapSeg III scoring document. The Ignoring Bottom Y column shows how the percentage would change if the threshold for the bottom Y coordinate of the segmentation position was ignored. Similarly, the Ignoring Bottom X and Y columns shows how the percentage would change if only the top, left, and right sides of the segmentation position were considered. These two supplemental columns are included because it has traditionally been difficult to determine the exact location of the distal interphalangeal joint. Table 2.2 shows how successful dermalog+0002 segmented fingers for each subject in the test corpus. Table 2.3 shows success for specific finger positions over the entire test corpus. Similarly, Table 2.4 shows success for segmenting the same finger position from both hands. The remainder of the tables show success per subject when considering combinations of subsets of the fingers on each slap image. Table 2.5 shows success for combinations of all fingers, Table 2.6 for just the index and middle fingers, and Table 2.7 for all except the little finger. Table 2.2: For each subject, the percentage that at least Number of Fingers fingers were correctly segmented, regardless of hand, for a maximum of eight correctly-segmented fingers. In Standard Scoring, scoring rules are followed exactly. In Ignoring Bottom Y, the bottom left and bottom right Y coordinates are ignored.

This may happen for a technical reason (e.g., the algorithm cannot parse the image data), or for a practical reason (e.g., the hand in the image is placed incorrectly). These failure scenarios are the result of capturing improper image data. In these types of scenarios, it is important to examine the cause of the failure. With many live scan capture setups, segmentation is performed immediately after capture. If an algorithm can detect that it won’t be able to segment an image due to a technical or practical issue, it can alert the operator to perform a recapture before the subject leaves. The SlapSeg III API encourages algorithms to identify these failure reasons by specifying pre-defined deficiencies in the image. Algorithms should attempt segmentation even if an image deficiency is encountered if at all possible. Note that SlapSeg III guarantees well-formed image data, so failures to parse are not an indicator of the data provided. dermalog+0002 did not report any capture failures. 2.4.1.1 Recovery When encountering a segmentation failure, SlapSeg III algorithms are encouraged to provide a best-effort segmentation when possible. In some cases, that best-effort may be correct, which reduces the amount of images that need to be manually adjudicated by an operator. dermalog+0002 did not attempt any recovery segmentations. 2.4.2 Segmentation Failures Even if an algorithm accepts an image for processing, it can still fail to process one or more fingers from the image, regardless of if the algorithm requested a recapture and provided best-effort segmentation. The SlapSeg III API allows algorithms to communicate reasons for failure to process these fingers. In some cases, the distal phalanx in question might not be present in the image due to amputation or being placed outside the platen’s capture area. It is imperative that the segmentation algorithm correctly report this as failing to segment the correct friction ridge generalized position without disrupting the sequence of valid positions present in the image. This can help prompt an operator to recapture or record additional information about the subject. In SlapSeg III, a number of images are missing fingers or otherwise have fingers that will not be able to be segmented. Reasons for segmentation failures reported by dermalog+0002 are enumerated in Table 2.8. Table 2.8: Count of self-reported segmentation failure reasoning.

Table 2.9 shows how successful dermalog+0002 was in correctly determining if a finger was missing. The Missed row shows when a segmentation position was returned for a missing finger. All possible failure reasons are enumerated, but are not considered Correctly Identified because the algorithm specified failure for a reason other than the finger not being found.

Table 4.2 shows how successful dermalog+0002 segmented fingers for each subject in the test corpus. Table 4.3 shows success for specific finger positions over the entire test corpus. Similarly, Table 4.4 shows success for segmenting the same finger position from both hands. The remainder of the tables show success per subject when considering combinations of subsets of the fingers on each slap image. Table 4.5 shows success for combinations of all fingers, Table 4.6 for just the index and middle fingers, and Table 4.7 for all except the little finger.

This may happen for a technical reason (e.g., the algorithm cannot parse the image data), or for a practical reason (e.g., the hand in the image is placed incorrectly). These failure scenarios are the result of capturing improper image data. In these types of scenarios, it is important to examine the cause of the failure. With many live scan capture setups, segmentation is performed immediately after capture. If an algorithm can detect that it won’t be able to segment an image due to a technical or practical issue, it can alert the operator to perform a recapture before the subject leaves. The SlapSeg III API encourages algorithms to identify these failure reasons by specifying pre-defined deficiencies in the image. Algorithms should attempt segmentation even if an image deficiency is encountered if at all possible. Note that SlapSeg III guarantees well-formed image data, so failures to parse are not an indicator of the data provided. Reasons for capture-type failures reported by dermalog+0002 are enumerated in Table 4.8. Table 4.8: Count of self-reported capture-type failure reasoning. Failure Reason Images Vendor Defined 16 4.4.1.1 Recovery When encountering a segmentation failure, SlapSeg III algorithms are encouraged to provide a best-effort segmentation when possible. In some cases, that best-effort may be correct, which reduces the amount of images that need to be manually adjudicated by an operator. dermalog+0002 did not attempt any recovery segmentations. 4.4.2 Segmentation Failures Even if an algorithm accepts an image for processing, it can still fail to process one or more fingers from the image, regardless of if the algorithm requested a recapture and provided best-effort segmentation. The SlapSeg III API allows algorithms to communicate reasons for failure to process these fingers. In some cases, the distal phalanx in question might not be present in the image due to amputation or being placed outside the platen’s capture area. It is imperative that the segmentation algorithm correctly report this as failing to segment the correct friction ridge generalized position without disrupting the sequence of valid positions present in the image. This can help prompt an operator to recapture or record additional information about the subject. In SlapSeg III, a number of images are missing fingers or otherwise have fingers that will not be able to be segmented. Reasons for segmentation failures reported by dermalog+0002 are enumerated in Table 4.9. Table 4.9: Count of self-reported segmentation failure reasoning. Failure Reason Fingers Finger Not Found 910 Finger Found, but Can’t Segment 0 Vendor Defined 0 4.4.3 Identifying Missing Fingers A small portion of the test corpus in SlapSeg III are missing fingers. Table 4.10 shows how successful dermalog+0002 was in correctly determining if a finger was missing. The Missed row shows when a segmentation position was returned for a missing finger. All possible failure reasons are enumerated, but are not considered Correctly Identified because the algorithm specified failure for a reason other than the finger not being found.

Result Percentage Missed 30.4 Correctly Identified 63.5 Other Failure: Finger Found, but Can’t Segment 0.0 Other Failure: Vendor Defined 0.0 Other Failure: Segmentation Not Attempted 6.1 4.4.4 Sequence Error Sequence error occurs when a fingerprint is segmented from an image but assigned an incorrect finger position (e.g., segmenting a right middle finger but labeling it a right index finger). Table 4.11 shows cases in which a segmentation position was returned that matched a ground truth segmentation position for a different finger in the same image.

To be evaluated under SlapSeg III, algorithms must segment the timing corpus, on average, in under 1 500 milliseconds. This maximum reference time is documented in the SlapSeg III test plan, and is subject to change. Times are measured by running a single process on an isolated compute node equipped with an Intel Gold 6254 CPU (submissions received prior to February 2022 were timed with a Intel Xeon E5-4650 CPU). Box plots of segmentation times are separated by slap orientation in Figure 5.1. Tabular representations are enumerated in Table 5.1. Results are reported in milliseconds.

Plots of segmentation centers for the right hand EightInch data are shown in Figure 5.2 and plots of segmentation centers for the left hand are shown in Figure 5.3. Blank lines that may appear in the plots are not rendering artifacts. Rather, they are indicative of image downsampling. Centers have been normalized to 500 pixels per inch. Points in each plot are plotted with a semi-transparent opacity. This results in points of particular color appearing “darker” to indicate a higher frequency of the observed value, while “lighter” points indicate a lower observed frequency.

Figure 5.5: Segmentation position dimensions for left hand EightInch data. 5.3 Detailed Segmentation Statistics NOTE: The following segmentation statistics are based on a limited subset (approximately 15%) of the anticipated Full Palm dataset. This analysis will be updated as soon as NIST can obtain the remainder of the dataset. This section shows detailed results of segmentation of EightInch data. Values in each table are the percentage that the variable in the left-most column was correctly segmented. Each table has three columns of percentages. The Standard Scoring column shows the percentage of correctly-segmented positions based on the scoring metrics defined in the SlapSeg III scoring document. The Ignoring Bottom Y column shows how the percentage would change if the threshold for the bottom Y coordinate of the segmentation position was ignored. Similarly, the Ignoring Bottom X and Y columns shows how the percentage would change if only the top, left, and right sides of the segmentation position were considered. These two supplemental columns are included because it has traditionally been difficult to determine the exact location of the distal interphalangeal joint. Table 5.2 shows how successful dermalog+0002 segmented fingers for each subject in the test corpus. Table 5.3 shows success for specific finger positions over the entire test corpus. Similarly, Table 5.4 shows success for segmenting the same finger position from both hands. The remainder of the tables show success per subject when considering combinations of subsets of the fingers on each slap image. Table 5.5 shows success for combinations of all fingers, Table 5.6 for just the index and middle fingers, and Table 5.7 for all except the little finger.
