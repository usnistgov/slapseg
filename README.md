Slap Fingerprint Segmentation Evaluation
========================================

Slap Fingerprint Segmentation Evaluation (SlapSeg) is a series of public tests
of automated slap fingerprint segmentation algorithms. Fingerprint segmentation
is the act of separating or segmenting an image of the friction ridge structure
of the hand into individual images of the upper-most finger joints, known as
distal phalanges. The evaluation has been conducted by the Image Group at the
National Institute of Standards and Technology since 2004.

Tests
-----
The current iteration of SlapSeg is [*SlapSeg III*][ss3-gh], which incorporates
evaluation of tenprint cards, identification flats, upper palm, and full palm
images. Previous tests include [SlapSeg II] (2008-2018) and [SlapSeg 04]
(2004-2005).
