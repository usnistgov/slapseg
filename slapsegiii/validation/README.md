SlapSeg III Validation
======================

We require exercising SlapSeg III [API] implementations with the SlapSeg III
validation package. Validation is mutually-beneficial to NIST and SlapSeg III
participants. The hope is that successful execution of validation ensures your
algorithm:

 * runs as expected at NIST;
 * does not crash;
 * syntactically and semantically implements the [API] correctly.

This helps cut the runtime of the evaluation and gives a higher
level of confidence that the results presented by NIST are a true measure of
the submitted software.

Contents
--------
 * Interaction Required:
   - [lib/]: Directory in which all required libraries reside. There must be at
     least one *core* library, and that library **must** follow the SlapSeg III
     naming convention.
   - [src/libslapsegiii/]: Code for the shared library implementing methods
     declared in [src/slapsegiii.h].
   - [src/slapsegiii.h]: The SlapSeg III [API].
   - [validate]: (*coming soon*) Script that automates running the validation
     and performing checks on the output.
 * Supporting Files
   - [README.md]: This file.
   - [src/]: Source code to build the validation executable.
   - [VERSION]: Version number of the validation package.

Requirements
------------

 * Fingerprint Imagery
   - Because organizations must agree to NIST Special Database terms and
     conditions, the required fingerprint imagery is not included in this GitHub
     repository. Download the data (*coming soon*) by requesting it from our
     website after agreeing to the terms.
 * CentOS 7.6.1810
   - Even if this is not the latest version of CentOS, it will be the version
     used to run the evaluation. Direct downloads are available from the [CentOS
     Vault] ([ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ USA], [ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º Europe]).
   - The [validate] script  requires these base CentOS packages:
      - `binutils`, `centos-release`, `coreutils`, `curl`, `file`, `gawk`,
        `gcc`, `grep`, `iputils`, `make`, `sed`, `which`, `yum`

It is **highly suggested** that you make sure your submission will build and run
as expected on environments as close as possible to the NIST evaluation
machines, in order to avoid validation delays. The CPUs used for SlapSeg III are
**Intel Xeon E5-2680** and **Intel Xeon E5-4650**.

How to Run
----------
 1. Put your compiled core library and any other required libraries in [lib/].
 2. Put SlapSeg III fingerprint imagery received from NIST in this directory
    (i.e., the directory containing this file, [README.md]).
 3. Execute [validate].
    - If you would like us to publish a marketing or brand name as part of your
      SlapSeg III report, indicate it by setting the variable
      `SLAPSEGIII_MARKETING_NAME` before executing.
 4. **If successful**, sign *and* encrypt the resulting output archive in a
    single step, and e-mail it, along with the encrypting identity's public key,
    to slapseg@nist.gov. If unsuccessful, correct any errors described and try
    again.

================================================================================
You have successfully completed the first step in SlapSegIII validation. Please
sign and encrypt this file, send it to slapseg@nist.gov, and await a
notification.

validation_nfseg_5001.tar.gz

Example encryption:
gpg --output validation_nfseg_5001.tar.gz.asc \
    --default-key jdoe@nfseg.com \
    --recipient slapseg@nist.gov \
    --recipient jdoe@nfseg.com \
    --armor --sign --encrypt \
    validation_nfseg_5001.tar.gz

Additionally, be sure to include the public key of the identity that signed the
validation package. This key must be the key whose key fingerprint was printed
on the SlapSegIII application.

Example public key extraction:
gpg --output nfseg_5001_public_key.asc --armor \
    --export jdoe@nfseg.com

Submission Contents
-------------------
 * canary.log: MD5 checksums of randomly-generated images we provide as part of
   the validation fingerprint imagery. This helps us make sure that you are
   using the most recent version of SlapSeg III validation fingerprint imagery.
 * compile.log: Output from compiling the validation executable and other
   information like MD5 checksums, versions, and library dependencies that may
   help us debug your submission if an error occurs.
    - This file contains absolute paths to files on your system. If this
      information is sensitive, you may redact the paths only.
 * id.log: Information about the linked core library, including supported slap
   sizes. This is information derived from values compiled into the core library
   or passed to [validate].
 * lib: A copy of [lib/].
 * run-orientation.log: The command used to launch the validation executable
   for orientation determination.
 * run-segments.log: The command used to launch the validation executable for
   segmentation
 * orientation-#.log: The output from the validation executable containing
   hypothesized orientations for each slap image provided.
 * segments-#.log: The output from the validation executable containing
   segmentation positions for each slap image provided.

Checks Performed
----------------

 * Implementation can handle being `fork`ed.
 * Validation package and imagery is at most recent revision level.
 * Appropriate operating system version installed.
 * Appropriately named SlapSeg III core software library is present.
 * Software library links properly against the validation driver.
 * Crashes do not occur when handling challenging images, such as:
   - missing fingers;
   - touching fingers;
   - blank or gradient patterns.
 * Segmentation positions are within the image for non-rotated slaps.
 * Segmentation positions are rectangular.
 * Segmentation positions are not rotated when not permitted.

While the validation package tries to eliminate errors from the SlapSeg III
submission, it is not perfect, and there are still several ways in which the
package might approve you for submission that NIST may later reject.
